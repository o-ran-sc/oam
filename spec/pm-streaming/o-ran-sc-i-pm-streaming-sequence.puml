' What happens when PM job on NF is removed? (And How?)
' draft: The SMO wont be informed about new measurements â€“ no ves file ready or no pm-stream based on the PM job.
' The PM Job can be deactivated (admin-state to locked) or removed via NETCONF operation defined in 3GPP yang modules -> O1.

' Should DME job be automatically removed?
' draft: Here we should start developing an answer ðŸ˜Š
' The DME job â€“ does it depend on the PM job or does it control the PM job?
